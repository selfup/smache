defmodule Secret do
  @moduledoc """
  Secret was written in Non Compiled Elixir for the following reasons:

  1. High entropy secret generation in bash only works on Linux
  2. Almost works all the way on macOS - but doesn't
  3. Git Bash for Windows (not WSL) doesn't support much
  4. You need Elixir for this project - therefore this will work

  To run: `elixir ./scripts/secret_gen.exs`

  This file is run by other scripts - no real need to run this manually
